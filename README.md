Hi all, recently I bought a Angular-The Complete Guid(2023 Edition) => bought on 25th November, 2022<br>
So I want to keep a record of what I'm learning there in this repository "Angular-Learning-Record". This is moreover like a diary...!<br>
I'll also upload the worked file here so that it will be more helpful for me as well as those who read this contents!<br><br>
## Day 1(27/11/22):<br>
     Today I've learned about Angular versions, Project setup, First App.
     
     Angular versions:
     The very first version of angular that is Angular 1 is also known as AngularJs and the other versions are just called as Angular
     with it's version numbers.
     Angular release updates in the time span of every 6 months
     
     CLI : Command Line Interface
     NPM : Node Package Manager
     
     Project Setup:
     (install node.js latest version first)
     -> npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
     
     First App:
     (open cmd of desirable folder location)
     -> ng new my-first-app --no-strict
     (project name should not contain any space and the name should not be 'test')
     Angular routing => No
     Stylesheet Format => CSS
     (it takes a lot time to create an app, so we have to wait a long time here!!)
     -> cd my-first-app
     -> ng serve
     (this command will live stream the app in a localhost site like 4040)
     use 'ctrl + c' command in cmd to exit the live stream window when we are done with the work or day!
